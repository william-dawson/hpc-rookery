"""Remote-execution layer: all cluster interaction funnels through here.

Built on remotemanager's Computer.cmd (a direct SSH exec, ~0.6s per call).
Three conventions are enforced in one place:

- Commands run under a login shell (the scheduler's own configuration is
  usually only visible through the login environment; a bare non-login
  shell often can't find it).
- The working directory is the user's home, so relative paths behave the
  way users expect.
- Commands and file contents travel base64-encoded, so arbitrary quoting
  survives the SSH layer intact.
- Non-zero exit codes raise RuntimeError so FastMCP surfaces a clean tool
  error; callers never need to parse error text from the return value.

Every function here takes an explicit `facility` (a config.Facility or its
slug) as its first argument — this one process serves every onboarded
facility, so there is no process-wide "the" cluster to talk to. Nothing in
this module touches config or SSH at import time — get_frontend() is built
lazily, on first use, inside a tool call. This is a deliberate invariant:
the MCP server must never fail to start because one facility's config is
missing or malformed; only an individual tool call that actually needs SSH
for that facility should fail, with a clear message pointing at the
configuring skill.

Extending this: a facility cannot edit this file. get_frontend()'s
Computer() construction (login-shell template, bash submitter, python3) is
a fixed default; if a facility genuinely needs different connection
parameters, set them via config.register_facility(computer_defaults=...) —
see config.COMPUTER_OPTION_NAMES for the full set.
