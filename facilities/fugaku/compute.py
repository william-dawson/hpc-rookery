"""PJMBackend — pjsub/pjstat/pjdel/pjalter implementation for Fugaku.

Fugaku is scheduled by Fujitsu's PJM ("Job Operation Software"), not Slurm or
Grid Engine, so per hpc-agent-core's PORTING.md §6 explicit fallback, this
subclasses SchedulerBackend directly rather than forcing a fit — the same
approach IreneAgent's BridgeBackend and Miyabi-Agent's PBSBackend took for
their own non-Slurm/non-GridEngine dialects.

Facts below were confirmed two ways: (1) RIKEN's official "user-guide-use"
Sphinx docs (job execution, MPI, and layered-storage sections), and (2) live
commands run directly against a real Fugaku login node during this port
(whoami/groups, pjstat --help, pjacl --rg small/large, storage layout) — see
this repo's AGENTS.md "Validation status" section for exactly what was and
wasn't exercised with a real submitted job.

Distinctive Fugaku facts this backend encodes:
- A project group is mandatory on every submission (#PJM -g <groupname>);
  the shared "fugaku" group every account belongs to is explicitly denied
  job submission (confirmed live via `pjacl --rg small`: "pjsub + deny
  g(fugaku)") — never hardcoded, see config.default_group().
- Fugaku (A64FX) has no GPUs — resources.gpus/gpu_cores_per_process are
  rejected rather than silently ignored.
- pjsub has no flag to override stdout/stderr paths at all (confirmed by
  the absence of any -o/-e/--out/--err entry in the official pjsub option
  tables) — output always lands at "<jobname>.<jobid>.out"/".err" in the
  submission directory. spec.stdout_path/stderr_path are rejected with a
  clear error rather than silently ignored.
- Second-layer storage volumes (e.g. "/vol0004") must be declared via
  #PJM -x PJM_LLIO_GFSCACHE=<volume> whenever a job needs more than $HOME —
  per-project, so resolved via config.default_gfscache_volume(), never
  hardcoded.
- pjstat's live table has no exit-code column; a finished job's EXT/EXIT
  state means the scheduler considers it done, not that the application
  succeeded — callers must check the job's .out/.err file, same caveat
  Miyabi's PBSBackend documents for its own history view.
