"""The unified MCP tool surface — one copy of every tool, shared by every
registered facility.

Every tool takes an explicit `facility` argument (the slug from
get_facilities(), e.g. "rikyu") as its first parameter and dispatches to
that facility's registered SchedulerBackend (facilities.registry) and
config.Facility (hpc_agent_core.config) — there is no per-facility copy of
this file. An unknown facility slug raises a ValueError listing every valid
slug (see config.get_facility / facilities.registry.get_backend), so a
wrong or guessed name fails loudly rather than silently reaching the wrong
cluster.

Tool groups mirror the IRI Facility API resource groups (facility, status,
account, compute, filesystem); see IRI_CHECKLIST.md at the repo root for
coverage. Tools are thin verbs — workflow knowledge (when to pick which
facility, how to read a failed job) lives in plugins/hpc/skills/, not in
long docstrings here.
