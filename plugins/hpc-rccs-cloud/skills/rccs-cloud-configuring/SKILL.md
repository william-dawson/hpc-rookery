# Configuring R-CCS Cloud

Settings live in `~/.hpc-agent/rccs_cloud.json` (the common directory
shared by every facility this plugin serves — one file per facility). Env
vars `RCCS_CLOUD_HOST` and `RCCS_CLOUD_EMBED_API_KEY` override the
file; the embedding key also falls back to a shared `RCCS_EMBED_API_KEY`
env var if several facilities share the same endpoint.

The file this facility needs (add `"embedding": {"api_key": "..."}` too if
docs search should use vector rather than keyword matching):

```json
{
  "ssh": {
    "host": "rccs-cloud"
  }
}
```

## What must be true before it can connect

The R-CCS Cloud accepts key-based SSH only. Add an 'rccs-cloud'
alias to ~/.ssh/config pointing at login.cloud.r-ccs.riken.jp with
your key, or set ssh.host to user@login.cloud.r-ccs.riken.jp.
No project account is needed — jobs without one use your default
Slurm account.
Running on an R-CCS Cloud front-end node instead of a laptop? Use
"host": "localhost" and no SSH key is needed at all.

## Guided setup — interview the user, then write the file

Read the existing `~/.hpc-agent/rccs_cloud.json` first and only ask
about what's missing or being changed.

1. **SSH** — ask how they reach this facility's login node:

   - An alias in `~/.ssh/config` (recommended) → `"host": "<alias>"`,
     targeting `login.cloud.r-ccs.riken.jp`.

   - **Running the agent session directly on this facility's own
     front-end/login node** (not a personal laptop)? Use
     `"host": "localhost"` instead — no SSH key needed. Skip the
     verification step below for this case; there's nothing to probe.
   - Verify with: `ssh -o BatchMode=yes <host> 'echo ok'` (BatchMode
     matters — the server cannot answer a password prompt; key-based auth
     is required). Not applicable for `"host": "localhost"`.
   - **Enable SSH multiplexing unless the user explicitly opts out.** This
     lets repeated agent operations reuse one authenticated connection rather
     than making the login node authenticate every call. Recommend an SSH
     alias and, after showing the exact change and receiving confirmation,
     add a narrowly scoped block to `~/.ssh/config` without overwriting any
     unrelated entries:
     ```sshconfig
     Host <alias>
       ControlMaster auto
       ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%C
       ControlPersist 30m
     ```
     Create `~/.ssh/controlmasters` with mode `0700`, then open the initial
     master in the user's own terminal with `ssh -MNf <alias>`. Set
     `ssh.host` to that same alias. `ControlMaster no` is an intentional
     opt-out; do not add or change multiplexing settings when it is present.
2. **Embedding API key** (optional — skippable; BM25 keyword search still
   works without it). Store it under `embedding.api_key`.
3. **Write the file** to `~/.hpc-agent/rccs_cloud.json` (`mkdir -p
   ~/.hpc-agent` first if needed), then `chmod 600` it — it may hold an API
   key. Never commit it or echo the key back in conversation.
4. **Validate**:
   ```bash
   uv tool run --quiet --from git+https://github.com/william-dawson/hpc-rookery.git@main hpc-doctor rccs-cloud
   ```
   (From a checkout of this repo: `.venv/bin/python -m hpc_mcp.doctor
   rccs-cloud` also works.)
5. **If the embedding endpoint was added or changed**, rebuild this
   facility's docs index:
   ```bash
   uv tool run --quiet --from git+https://github.com/william-dawson/hpc-rookery.git@main python -m hpc_mcp.ingest rccs-cloud
   ```
   Then run the doctor again — it should report "chunks with embeddings".

## Notes

- Settings are read fresh on every tool call, so a config file edit
  (including switching `ssh.host` to/from `"localhost"`) applies
  immediately — no server restart needed. A rebuilt docs index still needs
  the `hpc-docs` server restarted to be picked up.
- Off-network or without a key, docs search transparently falls back to
  BM25 keyword search over the same content — the plugin still works.
